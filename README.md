## Lessons Learned

This was a beneficial project because it helped me to identify issues in java when dealing with numerical calculations. One of the big issues I encountered was rounding errors. I sought to overcome this issue by manipulating the numerical data until I achieved the output that I wanted. 

This project also highlighted challenges in formatting and representations of numbers in java. I still have much to learn regarding these two areas and am not entirely happy with the visual representation of the output in this program.

One of the rewarding aspects of this project was discovering a pattern that could work in java code to achieve the desired results. The pattern I used could probably be simplified greatly with various techniques that I am not comfortable using yet, but I can see how valuable it is to identify patterns and simplify code using those patterns with more advanced techniques.
